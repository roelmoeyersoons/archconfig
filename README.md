# Arch migration configuration files

This repo contains a list of packages, inluding AUR packages, and their config files from Roel's old laptop. This repo is used as a starting point for migrating arch to a new laptop

## Todo:

* locales
* find and add /etc config files
* add encrypted secret files (wpa_supplicant, private keys,...)
* find more missing things
